Hoarder expects clients to send their authentication credentials in request headers. These credentials are provided to clients and they should be appended to request headers.


## Endpoints available for Hoarder

### `/status`

A GET endpoint that will allow registered devices to check if application is up. Registered devices will get success with status code 200 where as un-registered ones will get 403.

It expects request headers to contain `id` of client.

TODO: Ideal scenario would be timeout for requests from unregistered devices.


### `/clientel`

### `/message`

This requires a post message with following payload as post-body:
```
{

    "authToken": "token used by client to authenticate against Hoarder"
